# Customer Purchase Prediction with Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer purchase behavior using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model analyzes demographic and behavioral data to determine whether a customer is likely to make a purchase. The dataset contains features such as age, job, marital status, education, and more.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Cleaning and Handling Null Values

Missing values in the dataset have been addressed by removing rows with null values.

### 2. Extract Numerical and Categorical Columns

The dataset has been categorized into numerical and categorical columns for further analysis.

### 3. Data Visualization

Visualizations are employed to gain insights into the data distribution, including:
- Distribution of the target variable 'y'
- Categorical columns visualized using bar plots
- Boxplots for numerical columns

### 4. Convert Categorical Variables into Dummy/Indicator Variables

Categorical variables have been converted into dummy variables using one-hot encoding for compatibility with the decision tree model.

### 5. Check for Correlation

Correlation between features is examined and visualized to identify potential relationships.

### 6. Decision Tree Classifier

A Decision Tree Classifier has been employed to model the relationship between features and the target variable 'y'.

### 7. Display Decision Tree

The decision tree structure has been generated and displayed to enhance understanding of the model's decision-making process.
